<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

<div class="highlight">
<p><strong>The short version:</strong> By using WARDKEY, you agree to these terms. You own your data. We provide a tool to help you manage it securely. Use it responsibly.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the WARDKEY password manager application, browser extension, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service") provided by WARDKEY ("we," "us," "our"), located at 444 Alaska Avenue, Suite #AHA780, Torrance, CA 90503, USA.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service</li>
<li>You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account</li>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials</li>
<li>One person or entity may not maintain more than one free account</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
<p>WARDKEY is a password manager with zero-knowledge vault encryption that helps you securely store and manage passwords, payment cards, secure notes, TOTP keys, API keys, software licenses, passkeys, and other sensitive data. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local-first storage:</strong> Your vault is encrypted and stored on your device by default</li>
<li><strong>Optional cloud sync:</strong> Encrypted vault data can be synced across devices via our servers</li>
<li><strong>Browser extension:</strong> Autofill and save credentials on websites</li>
<li><strong>Password generator:</strong> Create strong, unique passwords</li>
<li><strong>TOTP authenticator:</strong> Store and generate time-based one-time password codes</li>
<li><strong>Security Monitor:</strong> Identify weak, reused, or old passwords</li>
<li><strong>Breach scanner:</strong> Check your passwords against the Have I Been Pwned database using k-anonymity (only partial password hashes are sent)</li>
<li><strong>Secure sharing:</strong> Share credentials via time-limited, view-limited encrypted links. Encryption keys are embedded in the URL fragment and never sent to our servers</li>
<li><strong>Emergency access:</strong> Designate trusted contacts who can request access to your vault with a configurable waiting period</li>
<li><strong>Import/Export:</strong> Import from other password managers (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, Chrome) and export your vault data</li>
<li><strong>AI-enhanced analysis (optional):</strong> Password Analyzer and Security Report powered by Anthropic's Claude AI send anonymized vault metadata (never passwords) to our servers. The Phishing Detector sends user-provided content (text or URLs you paste) for analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>

<li>You should store your master password securely and maintain a backup recovery method</li>
<li><strong>Loss of your master password may result in permanent loss of access to your encrypted data</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 Account Security</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep your account credentials confidential</li>
<li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to your account</li>
<li>Not share your account with others</li>

</ul>

<h3>4.3 Acceptable Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or to store illegal content</li>
