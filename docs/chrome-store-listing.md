## Detailed Description

WARDKEY is a local-first, AI-enhanced password manager that keeps your data on your device — not in someone else's cloud.

No account required. No credit card. Just install and go.

--- LAUNCH OFFER ---
WARDKEY is completely free with all features unlocked for a limited time. No limits, no restrictions — try everything.

--- WHAT MAKES WARDKEY DIFFERENT ---

Your vault is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and never leaves your device. There are no servers to breach, no cloud to compromise, and no company holding your data hostage behind a paywall.

Most password managers charge $3-5/month to store an encrypted list. WARDKEY gives you more — for free.

--- FEATURES ---
